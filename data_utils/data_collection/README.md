# questions weighted and grouped
* when we have more questions in the form and want to calculate culmunative score
* since the number of questions may be numerous but the coulm limit will be 26 (A-Z)
* if the data set is huge may have many sheets as possible
* it is okay if the number of question is less than 26 but the code is build for columnar data
